Description:

This one is about one third faster on my computer so i thought i'd submit
just in case :-)

I use an ugly hack based on IDA*. The search is chopped up into 12 steps
where each step is done with an IDA* search. I also do a BFS backwards from 
the solved cube with depth 10 using only sides D and B.
